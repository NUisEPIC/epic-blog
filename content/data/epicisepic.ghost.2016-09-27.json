The idea started out as NU Student Coffee, Northwestern’s first student run coffee shop, and developed into BrewBike, a trike serving cold brew coffee to the Northwestern community. I had the chance to sit down with Lucas and learn about the progression of their idea from a coffee shop to a bike with a cooler, in addition to his entrepreneurial experience as a whole.\n\nLucas said the he came up with the idea for NU Student Coffee after he joined Launch in the fall. At first, he felt lost in terms of what problem to address, and, like many other people, often thought of startups as being “tech-focused”. Once he began to consider starting something in a different industry, he remembered hearing about student-run coffee shops on tours at other colleges and realized there wasn’t one here at Northwestern. Lucas and Brammy starting working with Northwestern’s food service provider, Sodexo, on their original plan of redesigning Café Bergson, and housing NU Student Coffee there. Lucas described working with Sodexo as more of an “intrepreneurial” experience than an entrepreneurial one. They wanted to create something from scratch and come up with their own processes for deciding things such as how to run payroll, analyze finances, and make and serve coffee, instead of using Sodexo’s pre-established processes. After moving away from Sodexo, NU Student Coffee had to scale back and rethink their idea. They began to ideate, at one point coming up with a farmer’s market-style coffee tent, and eventually decided on BrewBike.\n\nLucas believes an entrepreneur is not just someone who comes up with an idea but can also implement and execute ideas that improve on what already exists. He “used to think [entrepreneurship] was just coming up with a cool idea and going for it”, but learned there was a lot more work in terms of compliance, in addition to things like branding and how the actual product is being served.        \n\n> “Brammy and I were very naïve in the beginning”, he says, “We thought they were just going to give us a space and we were going to be able to redesign it and just start doing our thing”. \n\nLucas feels that as their idea changed directions and progressed, they were able to figure out what exactly they wanted to learn and turn their vision into a venture in which they can learn those things and also provide value to the Northwestern community. Lucas and Brammy are looking forward to getting multiple bikes and expanding the team as much as necessary, including people who can help out with things like logos, accounting, and the actual process of serving the coffee.\n\nTo learn more, check out their Indiegogo page at https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/brewbike-northwestern-s-first-mobile-coffee-shop#/ ","html":"<p>You may have heard by now about BrewBike, the student coffee startup launched by freshmen garage residents Lucas Philips and Brammy Geduld.

The ride, full of music and conversation, came to an end as Loyola Retreat Center’s pretty complex revealed itself amongst the trees. We met the center’s staff and were assigned to our rooms. After dinner and name games, members intermingled and played a multitude of games. Distance from everyday responsibilities lead to a relaxed atmosphere and allowed for new relationships to develop. Time flew by unnoticed until yawns began to interrupt discussion. Slowly, the group dwindled as people returned to their beds at the end of a long day.\n\nThe day started with a big breakfast, then the EPIC team went outside for various team building exercises. Limits were tested on the ropes course, while others enjoyed the thrill of zip ling. On the ropes course that made one queasy to look down, we could complete the obstacles, relying on your partner, while suspended in the air. Everyone shared in the exhilaration of reaching the ground alive and matured. Down the path, teammates oversaw each other’s safety on the zip line and bonded over the excitement and view of the area.\n\nTeams reunited over a much needed lunch to exchange tales of their activities and meet members from other teams.

The ride, full of music and conversation, came to an end as Loyola Retreat Center’s pretty complex revealed itself amongst the trees. We met the center’s staff and were assigned to our rooms. After dinner and name games, members intermingled and played a multitude of games. Distance from everyday responsibilities lead to a relaxed atmosphere and allowed for new relationships to develop. Time flew by unnoticed until yawns began to interrupt discussion. Slowly, the group dwindled as people returned to their beds at the end of a long day.</p>\n\n<p>The day started with a big breakfast, then the EPIC team went outside for various team building exercises. Limits were tested on the ropes course, while others enjoyed the thrill of zip ling. On the ropes course that made one queasy to look down, we could complete the obstacles, relying on your partner, while suspended in the air. Everyone shared in the exhilaration of reaching the ground alive and matured. Down the path, teammates oversaw each other’s safety on the zip line and bonded over the excitement and view of the area.</p>\n\n<p>Teams reunited over a much needed lunch to exchange tales of their activities and meet members from other teams.
